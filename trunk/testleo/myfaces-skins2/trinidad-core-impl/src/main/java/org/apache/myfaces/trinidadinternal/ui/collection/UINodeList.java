/**
 * Interface for lists of UINodes.  This class is implemented by MutableUINode
 * subclasses that wish to change how the list of indexed children
 * in a MutableUINode are stored.
 * <p>
 * Because the RenderingContext is passed to both the <code>size</code> and
 * <code>getUINode</code> methods, the contents of the UINodeList can
 * be proxied through the RenderingContext.  In fact this is how
 * some instances of DataObjectListNodeList work, building a UINodeList
 * from a DataObjectList retrieved from a BoundValue.  However, the amount of
 * proxying that may be accomplished is limited by the fact that the
 * mutating methods do not take a RenderingContext, thus, it is impossible
 * to create a mutable UINodeList that acts as the concatenation of two
 * other UINodeLists.
 * <p>
 * @version $Name:  $ ($Revision$) $Date$
 * @see org.apache.myfaces.trinidadinternal.ui.BaseMutableUINode#setIndexedNodeList
 * @see DataObjectListNodeList
 * @deprecated This class comes from the old Java 1.2 UIX codebase and should not be used anymore.
