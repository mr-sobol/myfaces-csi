/**
 * The HelpProvider abstract class provides flexible mechanism for enabling
 * context-sensitive help from applications created with the UIX UI Components
 * or UIX language.  HelpProvider is a bean that defines
 * two standard Map and a set of standard keys.
 * <p>
 * Similar to most UI frameworks, context sensitive help in the UIX Framework
 * is topic-id based.  Developers use topic-ids in their pages and components,
 * and these topic-ids are passed to the help technology which resolves the
 * topic-id at runtime and displays the desired help topic.  In UIX, developers
 * will be able to use topic-ids as keys to the "helpTopic" Map when
 * data-binding the destination attribute of various components
 * (links, buttons, global buttons).  In addition, the developer will
 * be able to use the standard HelpProvider constant keys (like FRONT_PAGE_KEY)
 * when data-binding destinations using the "helpSystem" Map to
 * display navigation and system pages in the help system.
 * <p>
 * HelpProvider can be extended to support a variety of different help
 * technologies. Subclasses only need to implement the getHelpSystemValue()
 * method and the getHelpTopicValue() method.  Implementations can use
 * various schemes to create the value returned for a given topic-id or
 * system key (remember that the value will be used as a destination).
 * <p>
 * For example, a simple getHelpTopicValue() implementation would simply
 * map the topic-ID to the URL of a static webpage, and return that string URL
 * as the value.  A HelpProvider subclass for a web-based help system, like the
 * OracleHelpProvider, may choose to generate a URL off to a separate
 * servlet and simply pass the topic-id as a parameter.
 * <p>
 * Most HelpProvider subclasses will wish to return a javascript pseudo URL
 * that will launch a secondary window for displaying the help topic.  See
 * the SecondaryWindowHelpProvider abstract class for more information.
 *
