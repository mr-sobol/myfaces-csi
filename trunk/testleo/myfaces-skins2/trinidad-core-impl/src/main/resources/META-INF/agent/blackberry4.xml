  <!-- note the following that is not captured in the capability list:
       1) textPresentation:  BlackBerry Browser 4.0 does not support all
       of the XHTML text presentation module (5.4.1), specifically not 
       {sub, sup} (this matches XHTML MP)
       2) -adfinternal-nowrap:  although the nowrap attribute can be 
       specified on td, it does not behave as a user might expect;
       if the content of the nowrap cell is too long to fit on a single line,
       all cells in the table appear on its own line; if the content is still
       too long to fit on a single line of the display, the cell's content will
       still wrap
       3) the documentation for BlackBerry Browser 4.0 claims only XHTML
       Mobile Profile (XHTMLMP) support, but the actual implementation does
       support some other XHTML features (e.g. script); we specify capabilities
       that match the "real world" device
