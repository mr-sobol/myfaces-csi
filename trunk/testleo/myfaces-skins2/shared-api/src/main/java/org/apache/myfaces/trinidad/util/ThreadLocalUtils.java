/**
 * Utility functions related to ThreadLocals.
 * This class provides utilities for managing the lifecycles of ThreadLocals.
 * In particular, many application servers do not clean up the ThreadLocals
 * added to the request thread before returning the request thread to
 * its thread pool.  This may have several severe side-effects, including
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Leakage of objects referenced by the thread local</li>
 *   <li>Possible security holes if the ThreadLocals contents are reused
 *       on a request for a different user.</li>
 *   <li>Leakage of the entire class loader in live patching scenarios</li>
 *   <li>ClassCastExceptions in live patching scenarios</li>
 * </ol>
 * To avoid these problems, this class provides utilities for creating
 * and registering ThreadLocals that will be removed from the thread
 * automatically at the end of the current request.
 * @see #newRequestThreadLocal
