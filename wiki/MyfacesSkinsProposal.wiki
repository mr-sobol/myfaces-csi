#summary Proposal for project myfaces-skinning

= Summary =

The objective of this project is provide a framework for skin JSF components, refactoring the existing trinidad related code. Do this allows other JSF component frameworks like trinidad itself, tomahawk or tobago use it.

= Background =

On year 2007, several efforts where made in this field during GSOC 2007. A discussion about a myfaces skinning module where done here:

http://markmail.org/message/swxy73e3cth5zzaj?q=%5BSkinning%5D+independent+MyFaces+skinning+module

A big question raised on that time where how to separate skin code in order to remain compatibility with trinidad.

= Objectives =

 * Build a single skinning api that can be use by JSF component frameworks like trinidad, tomahawk or tobago, based on existing trinidad skin api.
 * Provide generic (basic support for any JSF framework) and tomahawk support (using extensions filter and modify existing tomahawk renderers to use this skinning api, so this api will be a dependency for tomahawk).

= Restrictions =

 * Any solution proposed must be compatible with trinidad (Read "compatible" as trinidad could use it in the future with little changes).
 * Since this is a new feature proposed for tomahawk, it should be optional use it.

= Benefits =

 * Enhance component set integration of Myfaces component frameworks.
 * Makes easier to users and developers add skinning features to custom JSF components.
 * Reduce the amount of work required to maintain myfaces code.

= Proposed Code =

The code available on http://myfaces-csi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testleo/myfaces-skins2/ contains a solution for this project.
