#summary Proposal for project myfaces-skinning

= Summary =

The objective of this project is provide a framework for skin JSF components, refactoring the existing trinidad skin code. Do this allows other JSF component frameworks like trinidad itself, tomahawk or tobago use it.

= Background =

On year 2007, several efforts where made in this field during GSOC 2007. A discussion about a myfaces skinning module where done here:

http://markmail.org/message/swxy73e3cth5zzaj?q=%5BSkinning%5D+independent+MyFaces+skinning+module

A big question raised on that time where how to separate skin code in order to remain compatibility with trinidad.

= Objectives =

 * Provide a single skinning api that can be use by JSF component frameworks like trinidad, tomahawk or tobago.

= Restrictions =

 * Any solution proposed must be compatible with trinidad (Read "compatible" as trinidad could use it in the future with little changes).

= Benefits =

 * Enhance component set integration for Myfaces frameworks.

= Plan =

= Proposed Code =

The code available on http://myfaces-csi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testleo/myfaces-skins2/ contains a solution for this project.
