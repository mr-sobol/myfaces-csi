#summary Proposal for project myfaces-skinning

= Summary =

The objective of this project is provide a framework for skin JSF components, refactoring the existing trinidad related code. Do this allows other JSF component frameworks like trinidad itself, tomahawk or tobago use it.

= Background =

On year 2007, several efforts where made in this field during GSOC 2007. A discussion about a myfaces skinning module where done here:

http://markmail.org/message/swxy73e3cth5zzaj?q=%5BSkinning%5D+independent+MyFaces+skinning+module

A big question raised on that time where how to separate skin code in order to remain compatibility with trinidad.

= Objectives =

 * Build a single skinning api that can be use by JSF component frameworks like trinidad, tomahawk or tobago, based on existing trinidad skin api.
 * Provide generic (basic support for any JSF framework) and tomahawk support (using extensions filter and modify existing tomahawk renderers to use this skinning api, so this api will be a dependency for tomahawk).

= Restrictions =

 * Any solution proposed must be compatible with trinidad (Read "compatible" as trinidad could use it in the future with little changes).
 * Since this is a new feature proposed for tomahawk, it should be optional use it.

= Benefits =

 * Enhance component set integration of Myfaces component frameworks.
 * Makes easier to users and developers add skinning features to custom JSF components.
 * Reduce the amount of work required to maintain myfaces code.

= Proposed Code =

The code available on http://myfaces-csi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/testleo/myfaces-skins2/ contains a solution for this project.

The temporal layout for this project is this:

||shared-api|| Utilitary code used by skin-api but not related to it (some parts should be on myfaces commons utils but others could be on skin-api).||
||shared-impl|| Utilitary code used by skin-impl but not related directly to it (for example, code related to parse xml files,...) Maybe this code could be bundled with skin-impl.||

||skin-api|| Code that comes from trinidad-api related to skinning.||
||skin-impl|| Code that comes from trinidad-impl related to skinning but not trinidad specific.||

||trinidad-core-api|| Trinidad 1.2.x version that uses skin-api, just to check compatibility and track changes necessary to do so||
||trinidad-core-impl|| Trinidad 1.2.x version that uses skin-api, just to check compatibility and track changes necessary to do so||

||skins-support-shared|| Classes required to add skin support, common to other support modules.||
||tomahawk-support|| Tomahawk support for skinning. Contains tomahawk specific classes to use skin-api and skin-impl with tomahawk. It uses AddResource api to serve css files.||
||generic-support|| Generic support for skinning. Contains specific classes to use skin-api and skin-impl with tomahawk. It uses SkinResourceServlet to serve css files.||

||skins-example-generic|| Demo using generic support.||
||skins-example-tomahawk|| Demo using tomahawk support.||
||trinidad-examples|| Copy of trinidad examples module to check that trinidad-core-api and trinidad-core-impl works correctly.||
