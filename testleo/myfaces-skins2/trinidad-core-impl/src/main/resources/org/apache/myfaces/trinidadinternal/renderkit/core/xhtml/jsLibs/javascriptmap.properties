# ADDING NEW ALIASES
# LHS=RHS
# LHS - Represents the name of the JavaScript file
# RHS - Represents the Alias Name for the JavaScript
# Effect - The Contents of the JavaScript file will be copied into a file
# whose name wil be the alias name.
# E.g.
#
# File1.js=SomeAlias
# File2.js=SomeAlias

# File3.js=OtherAlias
# File4.js=OtherAlias

# The effect of this would be a new file by name 'SomeAlias.js' will be created
# and to it the contents of 'File1.js' and 'File2.js' will be concatenated.

# A file by the name 'OtherAlias.js' will be also created and to it the
# contents of 'File3.js' and 'File4.js' will be concatenated.
