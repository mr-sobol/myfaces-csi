/**
 * Interface for storing a node of a UIX Components UI tree.
 * <p>
 * Children of this UINode are stored in two separate fashions--by name or
 * by index.  How a child node is stored is dependent upon the contract
 * between a UINode and its Renderer.  For example, a Renderer that renders
 * an arbitrary separator between each of its children may use a named
 * child to indicate the UINode to use to render the separator, while the
 * indexed children are used to indicate the children to render.
 * <p>
 * <EM>Note that other UINodes referenced by a UINode should be stored as
 * either named children or indexed children.  They should not be stored
 * as attributes or private state.</EM>
 * <p>
 * UINodes do not store references to their parent UINodes.  This allows
 * the same instance of a UINode subtree to appear in multiple locations
 * in the UINode tree.
 * <p>
 * @version $Name:  $ ($Revision$) $Date$
 * @deprecated This class comes from the old Java 1.2 UIX codebase and should not be used anymore.
