   * Tests whether the ClientAction should be invoked using an
   * explicit trigger such as a button or link.
   * <p>
   * In general, ClientActions are executed in response to user interaction
   * with an input control, such as selecting an item from a choice component
   * or radio button group, or tabbing out of a text input component. In some
   * cases the ClientAction may provide a script which should not be fired in
   * response to the normal user input, but instead should only be executed in
   * response to an explicit request from the end user. For example, the
   * partial page rendering ClientActions revert to full page rendering in
   * environments where partial page rendering is not supported (such as
   * Netscape 4.x). However, performing a full page render in response to user
   * interaction such as tabbing out of a text input component would be
   * confusing to the end user. Instead, the {@link #isTriggerRequired
   * isTriggerRequired()} method can be used to indicate that an explicit
   * trigger, such as a "Go" button, should be used to invoke the action.
   * <p>
   * Components which support ClientActions should call this method before
   * calling {@link #getScript getScript()} to determine whether or not an
   * explicit trigger is required. If {@link #isTriggerRequired
   * isTriggerRequired()} returns true, {@link #renderTrigger renderTrigger()}
   * should be called to render content which includes a trigger (a link or
   * button) which invokes the action.
   * <p>
   * Components which are themselves explict triggers (link or button
   * components) may call {@link #getScript getScript()} instead of {@link
   * #renderTrigger renderTrigger()} even if {@link #isTriggerRequired
   * isTriggerRequired()} returns true. In some cases the ClientAction
   * implementation may be able to provide a script which can be invoked by
   * link/button components, in which case an auxiliary trigger is not
   * necessary.
