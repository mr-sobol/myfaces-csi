 * This embarrassingly named interface is used to mark LookAndFeel

 * the LafIconProvider simply be casting to BaseLookAndFeel.  This
 * doesn't work now that we have LAFs which extend LookAndFeelExtension
 * instead of BaseLookAndFeel (such as OracleDesktopLookAndFeel).
 * We should remove this interface once we switch over to the new
