class OctreeQuantizer
{

  // The octree quantization method reduces a set of colors in an
  // image to a desired color palette size while maintaining as much
  // image quality as possible. The principle structure employed here
  // is an octree, or tree with a branching factor of 8. The tree is
  // also 8 nodes deep, as each color may be represented by an 8 bit
  // number.
  //
  // The image is scanned and pixel colors are read into the tree and
  // stored one at a time. Branch selection is as follows: at depth n,
  // the nth most significant r, g, and b values form rgb, a binary
  // number from 0 to 7. The red, green, and blue values of the entire
  // color are added to red, green, and blue fields at every node
  // along the way, so every node has the sum of color value for all
  // of its children. The number of unique colors in the tree is
  // noted, though red, green, and blue value totals per node as
  // described above are done for *each* pixel.
  // 
  // Once the number of unique colors exceeds the desired threshhold,
  // from 2 to 8 colors are combined into a single color. A search is
  // done from the bottom of the tree, since colors with a common
  // node share all of that nodes's parental hierarchy. Nodes in
  // deeper levels are combined first, however which node is combined
  // first within a row results in slightly different outcomes, which
  // are not discussed here. In this implementation, the first viable
  // node is reduced. 
  //
  // Once a node has been selected, its children are removed and it
  // takes a color equal to a weighted average of its children. Since
  // color sums are kept in each node, all that needs be done is
  // divide the total red, green, and blue values by the number of
  // pixels passing through the node.
  //
  // Note that further colors that would have been added to pruned
  // nodes are not added further than the prune. The image color is
  // not changed either, though red, green, and blue totals are still
  // updated as before.
  //
  // Once the image has been scanned in, it is trivial to map a color
  // to its equivalent from the new color table. Simply traverse the
  // tree as before, stopping when a node with no children is reached
  // and return that node's color value.
  //
  // This algorithm is made more efficient by the use of color lists
  // to more quickly find nodes to reduce. As nodes are created they
  // are added to the appropriate list for their level. When a reduce
  // is performed, the lists are scanned, one at a time, for a viable
  // node. If the end of a list is reached, the next highest list is
  // scanned, and no further node will ever be created in the lower
  // list. This thus makes the adding nodes operation progressively
  // faster.
