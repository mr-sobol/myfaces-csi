/**
 * Interface implemented to apply the visitor pattern to a set of components where the
 * components are not necessarily siblings of each other.  When <code>processComponent</code> is
 * called, the component instance is guaranteed to be in the correct context.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface are parameterized by the type of the callbackContext the implementor
 * expects.  The typical usage is that the implementor creates and instance of the desired context
 * and calls a helper method on a different object (for example
 * <code>UIXComponet.processComponent</code> with the desired ComponentProcessor and context
 * instances to actually perform the iteration.
 * <p>
 * Because the ComponentProcessor can't look ahead, more complex iteration tasks, such as
 * laying out and rendering components based on the number of components to render may
 * require multiple-passes--one to collect the layout information into the callbackContext using
 * one ComponentProcessor implementation and a second pass using a different ComponentProcessor
 * to actually perform the layout using the information calculated in the first pass.
